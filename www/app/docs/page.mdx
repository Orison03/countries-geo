These vast areas are distinguished by geographical boundaries, cultural differences, and unique ecosystems.                    |
| [Countries](/docs/countries)          | Countries are sovereign political entities with defined borders, governments, and populations. Each country has its own laws, currency, and identity, such as the United States, Brazil, or Japan.                                                                                                  |

For example, the U.S. has 50 states, India has 28 states, and Germany has 16 federal states.                                                                                             |
